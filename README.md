# Toxic Classification Model Training with TensorFlow

(`train_model.py`) trains an image classification model using TensorFlow. The model is trained on happy and sad images and predicts whether an input image is happy or sad.

## Prerequisites

Before running (`train_model.py`), make sure you have the required python libraries installed:

- TensorFlow (2.10)
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

**NOTE**: You also need to install CUDA toolkit 11.2 and cuDNN 8.1

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib pandas
